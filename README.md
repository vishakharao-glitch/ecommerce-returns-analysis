## 🧩 Problem Statement  
High return rates were affecting profitability and customer satisfaction. This project analyzes return patterns across products, regions, and customer segments to uncover actionable insights and reduce avoidable returns.

## 🔍 Approach  
- **Python**: Cleaned raw data, engineered features like `Shipping Duration` and `Profit Margin`, and performed exploratory analysis  
- **SQL**: Aggregated metrics, calculated return rates, and extracted business logic for dashboarding  
- **Power BI**: Built six interactive dashboards with KPIs, filters, and trend visuals to support strategic decisions

## 💡 Key Insights  
- 60% of returns came from just 3 product categories  
- First-time buyers had the highest return rates  
- Poor product descriptions and fragile SKUs were major return drivers  
- Premium shipping reduced return volatility for high-value orders
